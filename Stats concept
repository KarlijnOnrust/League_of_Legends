<h3>
  How I decided on stats
</h3>
<p>
First I made a list of champs with extreme stats, shown in "Selected".
I wanted to make a tank based on health. So I ordered the selected champs first on health. After health I ordered on armor and magic resist. I took the top champs with a bit corrosponding abilities: Tryndamere, Master Yi and Jax.
I took the mean of every stat from these champs lowering and highering some acording to champs with simular stats. I did this again with the main of all champs.
